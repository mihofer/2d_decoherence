# Tools for studying decoherence in the presence of amplitude detuning

This repository compiles the scripts and plots that were used for the IPAC23 WEPL024.
All functions are found in `decoherence_tools.py`, and usage is demonstrated in the python notebook `study.ipynb`.
The repository is set up for any visitor to try such analysis on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mihofer/2d_decoherence/HEAD).
